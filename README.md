## About the app
This application is meant to be a tool for users to understand trends and correlations better using the college data set in 2013-14 from IPEDS. Using a map, a scatter plot, and a table, users have a chance to explore and play around with the visualizations to investigate any interesting relationships, as well as new findings. The data set used for this project consists of various variables such as tuition, percent of women enrolled, and region, which would be helpful for people from different backgrounds. This ranges from professors who might be interested in finding any social inequalities to high schools students who might want to look into college data sets so that they can start narrowing down their interests. The limitation of this project is that the data set is outdated. Thus, any discovery made using this visualization may not be applicable today.


## About the dataset
The data was collected from “American University Data” IPEDS dataset found in Kaggle (citation), which contains information about US colleges. The original data was pulled from Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) owned by the US Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The NCES collects data and reports directly from colleges and universities that participates in the federal student financial aid programs.
